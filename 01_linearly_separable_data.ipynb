Throughout these sessions, you will learn how to use Python and the [sklearn package](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) to perform basic data science, using models to infer relationships from data. I'd encourage you to make use of the demonstrators here, as well as explore things at your own pace. There are potentially multiple ways of performing operations in these notebooks, and Paolo will go through the theoretics in his lectures. Remeber, Google and Stack Overflow are your friend - just try to understand the code you find rather than blindly copying it in!\n",
